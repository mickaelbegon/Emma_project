"""
This example shows how to create a batch of De Leva models within a range of anthropometry.
This could be useful if you want for example assess the impact of anthropometry on a movement.
Here, we want to create a population of female gymnasts performing acrobatics on the bars. Thus, the kinematic chain
will also be modified to place the root segment at the hands.
